Chat With Any LLM with a Key

# How This Tool Works

This tool lets you chat with powerful AI models (like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or OpenRouter) and generate images, all from your browser. Here’s how it works, in plain language:

## 1. Choose Your AI & Set Up
- Click the **Settings** section (top left) to pick your AI provider (OpenAI, Gemini, or OpenRouter), model name, and paste in your API key.
- Click **New Chat** to start a fresh conversation with your chosen model.

## 2. Chat Naturally
- Type your message in the prompt box at the bottom right.
- Press **Send** (or use Ctrl+Enter/Cmd+Enter) to get a reply from the AI.
- Your conversation appears above the prompt, newest messages at the bottom.
- You never lose sight of the prompt box, making it easy to keep chatting.

## 3. Manage Multiple Chats
- Every new chat you start is saved in the **Chat History** (left panel), grouped by provider and model.
- Click any chat in the history to view the full conversation.
- Delete chats you no longer need with the × button.

## 4. Generate Images
- If you ask for an image (e.g., “draw a cat in a spacesuit”) and use a model like gpt-4o, the tool will show the generated image right in the chat.

## 5. Everything Stays Local
- All your chats and keys are saved only in your browser. Nothing is sent anywhere except to the AI provider you choose.

## 6. Designed for Ease
- The sidebar with settings and chat history always stays visible (on desktop).
- The chat area scrolls independently, so you can always see the prompt box.
- Tooltips and friendly messages help you along the way.

**That’s it!**

Start a chat, explore different models, and manage your conversations—all in one clean, easy-to-use interface.
